            <div class="window">
                I created a website for a local company to sell their products. The website can be accessed <a
                href="http://cipandinvestacc.ro" style="color:indianred" target="_blank">here</a>. It displays all the
                information regarding
                selling, shipping and payment.
                The site prompts the user with multiple questions that may arise to make navigation and understanding
                easier. It provides a navigation bar
                to navigate tabs easier. It has a search mechanism, implemented in JavaScript, to find out if the
                product the buyer is looking for is available. As per the company's request, it does not have the
                possibility of making accounts, so the implementation is merely visual.

            <div class="window">

                The Battleship Game is a Java console-based two-player strategy game.
                Each player places their ships on a grid and then takes turns firing at their opponent's grid to sink
                their ships. The first player to sink all the opponent's ships wins. <br></br>

                <span class="small-window-title">How to Play </span> <br>

                Players take turns entering coordinates to fire shots at their opponent's grid.<br>
                The game provides feedback on hits and misses, and displays the current state of both players' grids.
                The game ends when one player sinks all the opponent's ships.
                <br> <br>
                <span class="small-window-title">Features </span> <br>

                Two-player interactive gameplay.
                Players can place their ships on the grid.
                Players take turns firing shots at their opponent's grid. <br>
                Visual display of the game board with ships and shots.

                <br> <br>
                <span class="small-window-title">How to Place Ships</span> <br>

                Players take turns placing their ships on their grid.
                Players input the coordinates for the start and end of the ship (e.g., A1 A5 or B5 E5). <br>
                The game validates the coordinates and adds the ship to the grid if valid.
                Different ship types have different lengths: Aircraft Carrier (5 cells), Battleship (4 cells), Cruiser
                (3 cells), Submarine (3 cells), and Destroyer (2 cells).
